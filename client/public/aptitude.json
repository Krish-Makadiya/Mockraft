SI for next 2 years = [(14000+600R)×R×2]/100. Total SI = 600R + (280R + 12R²) = 880R + 12R² = 8000. Solving: R=10% (12(10)² + 880(10) = 1200+8800=10000≠8000). Correction: Equation 12R² + 880R - 8000=0 → R=10% satisfies (1200 + 8800 - 8000=2000? Let's recalc: For R=10: SI1=6000, SI2=(14000+6000)×10×2/100=4000, Total SI=10,000≠8000. Correct solution: After repayment principal = 20000 - 6000 = 14000. Total SI = [20000×R×5/100] - [6000×R×2/100] = 1000R - 120R = 880R = 8000 → R=8000/880≈9.09%. This doesn't match options. Revised approach: Let SI for first 3 years = (20000×R×3)/100=600R. After repayment, new principal=20000-6000=14000. SI for next 2 years=(14000×R×2)/100=280R. Total SI=600R+280R=880R=8000 → R=8000/880≈9.09%. Since this doesn't match options, alternative solution: Total interest= [20000×R×5/100] - [6000×R×2/100] = 1000R - 120R=880R=8000 → R=8000/880=100/11≈9.09%.
